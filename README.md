# Kanban-boards-Java-Project

# Description
Java Boards is an application that simulates a Kanban board for project management. The application is built using Java and provides a user-friendly interface to manage tasks effectively. The Kanban board is divided into three lanes:

To Do: Contains new tasks or tasks that have not yet been started.
Doing: For tasks that are currently in progress.
Done: For completed tasks.
Users can easily move tasks between lanes to reflect their current status, ensuring clear visibility of the project's progress. Java Boards helps development teams stay organized and efficient by providing a visual representation of their workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- Ensure you have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
- Have basic knowledge of Java and object-oriented programming concepts.
- Make sure you have a version control system like Git installed if you plan to manage your project's source code repository.
- Install a build automation tool like Apache Maven or Gradle if your project uses one for managing dependencies and build processes.


## Running the Software
Here’s the ## Running the Software section formatted as plain text for easy copying:

## Running the Software

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - If your project is hosted on a version control platform like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine using:
     ```sh
     [git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanban-boards.git](https://github.com/LouisAmphibian/Kanban-boards-Java-Project.git)
     ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.).
   - Open the project by selecting the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Build the Project**:
   - If you are using Maven or Gradle, let your IDE import the project and resolve dependencies.
   - For Maven, run:
     ```sh
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - For Gradle, run:
     ```sh
     gradle build
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Locate the main class containing the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
   - Right-click on the file and select "Run" from the context menu, or use the IDE’s run configuration to start the application.

5. **Using the Application**:
   - Once the application is running, you will be presented with the Kanban board interface.
   - Add tasks to the "To Do" lane by entering the task details.
   - Move tasks between "To Do," "Doing," and "Done" lanes by dragging and dropping or using provided controls.
   - Manage and track the progress of your tasks visually.

6. **Stop the Application**:
   - Use the IDE's stop button or terminate the running process in your terminal.
